# Advanced SoDAR (Sound Detection And Ranging)

### The objective of this project is to create a cheap to produce yet effective detection system using only an arduino, ultrasonic sensor, and IMU (optional).

This is an easy (knock on wood) to implement system that can detect obstacles and simple objects. By using data from an IMU the orientation of the ultrasonic sensor can be known allowing the system to 3D map its surrounding area. A python program can be run alongside the arduino to read the serial output and generate 3D plots from the data in real time.
